Privacy Policy for ParkSheets

Last updated: June 5, 2025

Thank you for choosing ParkSheets (“we,” “our,” or “us”). We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal information. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our mobile applications ParkSheets (for Android) and ParkSheetsSwift (for iOS) (collectively, the “App”), including any related services, features, or content offered by us (collectively, the “Services”).

By using the App or Services, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with any part of this policy, please do not use our App or Services.

1. Information We Collect

We collect information directly from you, automatically via the App, and from third-party services as described below.

1.1 Personal Information You Provide

When you register, log in, or otherwise interact with the App, you may provide us with certain personally identifiable information, including but not limited to:
	•	Account & Authentication Data:
– Email address
– User ID (Firebase UID)
	•	Profile Information:
– Full name
– Company ID and location name (e.g., “Franklin,” “Allentown,” “OKC”)
	•	Form Responses / FormData:
– Answers to dynamic survey/dispatch fields (e.g., run number, year/make/model, service trouble code, enroute miles, tow miles, added services, etc.)
– Timestamps (dates) associated with each form entry
	•	Employee Data (Admin Section):
– Employee ID (Firestore document ID)
– Pay scale type (e.g., “commission,” “flat,” etc.)
– Pay type (e.g., “towBase,” “lsBase,” etc.)
– Percentage (if commission)
– Full name (first/last)
	•	Camera & OCR Images (optional, if you use the OCR feature):
– Photographs you take of your dispatch screen (the actual image data is encoded and sent to our backend or Cloud Function)
– The App itself does not permanently store camera images on your device—images are processed in memory, sent to OpenAI via our secure Cloud Function, and then immediately discarded.

1.2 Automatically Collected Information

When you use the App, we automatically collect certain information about your device and usage:
	•	Device & Usage Data:
– Device type (Android or iOS model)
– Operating system version
– App version
– Unique device identifiers (e.g., Advertising ID, Instance ID)
– Crash reports and performance metrics (via Firebase Crashlytics, if enabled)
	•	Log Data:
– IP address
– Timestamp of App activity (e.g., screen transitions, button taps)
– Analytics events (e.g., “Load Stats clicked,” “Save Pay-Scale,” etc.)
– Errors or exceptions encountered in the App or Cloud Functions

1.3 Third-Party & Service Provider Data

We also receive information about you from third-party services we integrate:
	•	Firebase (Authentication, Firestore, Storage, Crashlytics, Analytics):
– User authentication status (UID)
– Profile and session data (companyID, location)
– Crash and performance logs
– Aggregate usage analytics (screen views, feature usage, etc.)
	•	OpenAI (OCR Feature):
– When you activate OCR, we transmit a base64-encoded image to our Firebase Cloud Function, which in turn sends it to OpenAI’s Vision+Chat endpoint. The only data OpenAI receives is the image content and our hard-coded prompt. The raw image is not stored on our servers or in your device’s local storage; it is used for real-time processing and then discarded.
	•	Google Analytics / Crashlytics (Optional):
– Anonymous event data about how you navigate and interact with the App.
– Diagnostic data (crashes, freezes) to help us troubleshoot issues.

2. How We Use Your Information

We use the information we collect for the following purposes:
	1.	Account Creation & Management
	•	To register, authenticate, and authorize you to use the App via Firebase Authentication.
	•	To store and retrieve your profile (companyID, location, user role) and FormData in Firestore.
	2.	App Functionality & Core Features
	•	To fetch, display, and allow editing of dynamic form fields (dispatch entries).
	•	To load and save pay scales, employee assignments, and estimated compensation calculations.
	•	To enable the OCR feature: we temporarily convert an image to base64, send it to OpenAI via our Cloud Function, parse the JSON response, and populate UI fields (run number, year/make/model, service trouble code).
	•	To push new form data to a Google Sheet via our Cloud Functions (“addFormEntryToSheet” and “updateFormEntryInSheet”).
	3.	Analytics & Performance
	•	To monitor App usage patterns (e.g., number of entries per day, frequency of feature use).
	•	To detect and fix bugs or performance bottlenecks (via Firebase Crashlytics).
	•	To maintain and improve the overall user experience.
	4.	Notifications & Messaging (Future)
	•	If you opt in, to send push notifications (e.g., reminders to load stats, new pay scale published).
	•	To send in-App or email alerts for system updates, bug fixes, or feature announcements.
	5.	Legal & Security
	•	To comply with applicable laws, regulations, or legal processes.
	•	To detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security, or technical issues.

3. How We Share & Disclose Your Information

We will not sell or rent your personal data to third parties. We may share your information in the following circumstances:
	1.	Service Providers & Third-Party Tools
	•	Firebase Services (Authentication, Firestore, Storage, Analytics, Crashlytics). All user data we store in Firestore resides on Google’s infrastructure and is subject to Google’s Terms of Service and privacy practices.
	•	OpenAI (OCR): Only when you explicitly invoke the OCR feature do we forward a base64 image and our prompt to OpenAI. OpenAI returns parsed JSON (run number, year, make, model, code). We never store raw images once the request completes.
	•	Google Sheets API (Cloud Functions): When you save a form, our Cloud Function reads the spreadsheetID from your FormData doc and appends or updates rows in your specified Google Sheet. This requires that your Google Account (or the service account) has edit access to that sheet.
	2.	Within Your Organization
	•	If you are part of a multi-location company, an Admin at your company may have access to your entries, employee assignments, and pay scale data for management or payroll purposes. This is controlled entirely via Firestore Security Rules (only “admin” role can read/write payScales and employee docs).
	3.	Legal Requirements
	•	If required by law (e.g., a valid subpoena, court order), or to protect our rights, property, or safety, we may disclose personal data to law enforcement or other government agencies.
	4.	Business Transfers
	•	In the event ParkSheets is acquired or merges with another entity, user data may be transferred to the successor organization. You will be notified and have an opportunity to opt out if required by law.

4. Data Retention & Deletion
	•	FormData & Firestore Records: We retain your FormData (dispatch entries) indefinitely, unless you or an Admin explicitly delete them within the App.
	•	Google Sheets Rows: When a form is created or updated (within 24 hours), we write that entry into the designated Google Sheet. We do not remove or overwrite historical rows older than 24 hours—except when a driver edits a dispatch within 24 hours (the Cloud Function locates the matching row by formID and updates it).
	•	OCR Images: Raw images captured via the camera and encoded to base64 are used only in memory and discarded immediately after the OpenAI API call. We do not store these images on our servers or permanently on your device.
	•	Analytics & Crashlytics Data: Retained according to Firebase’s default data retention policies (usually 30-90 days for logs, up to 12 months for aggregated usage data, depending on your Firebase console settings).

If you wish to delete your account or request that we remove all personal data, please email us at support@parksheetsapp.com. We will take commercially reasonable steps to delete or anonymize your data in Firestore and any associated Google Sheets (though you may also need to manually delete or archive rows in your own spreadsheet).

5. Data Security

We employ industry-standard security measures to protect your information:
	•	Encryption in Transit: All communication between the App and our servers (Firebase, Cloud Functions, OpenAI, Google Sheets API) occurs over HTTPS/TLS.
	•	Firebase Authentication: Protects access to Firestore.
	•	Firestore Security Rules: Limit data access based on custom claims (e.g., request.auth.token.companyID == resource.data.companyID && request.auth.token.location == …) and roles (admin, user).
	•	Google Cloud Function Environment: Secrets (OpenAI API key) are stored using firebase functions:config:set openai.key="YOUR_SECRET_KEY" and never embedded directly in client-side code.
	•	Key Management: For Android release builds, you store your keystore.properties (with passwords) locally, not in version control.

Although we strive to protect your data, no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure. In the unlikely event of a data breach, we will notify you and relevant authorities as required by law.

6. Children’s Privacy

Our App is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from anyone under 13. If you learn that a child under 13 has provided us with personal data, please contact us at support@parksheetsapp.com. We will promptly delete that information.

7. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we will:
	1.	Update the “Last updated” date at the top.
	2.	Post the revised policy in the App or at our Privacy Policy web page (e.g., www.parksheetsapp.com/privacy).
	3.	If material changes occur, provide a more prominent notice (e.g., push notification or in-App alert) and request your consent if required by applicable law.

Your continued use of the App after any revision indicates your acceptance of the updated terms.

8. Your Rights & Choices
	•	Access & Correction: You can review and update your profile information (full name, companyID, location) by signing into the App and editing your Firestore user record (if permitted).
	•	Data Deletion: To delete your Firestore data (FormData, user profile), please contact us at support@parksheetsapp.com with a “Subject: Data Deletion Request.” We will remove or anonymize your data within a reasonable timeframe.
	•	Opt-Out of Analytics: If you do not wish to be included in analytics or crash reporting, you can disable Firebase Analytics or Crashlytics tracking on your device settings.
	•	Contacting Us: For any privacy-related inquiries, or to exercise any rights under GDPR, CCPA, or other applicable laws, please email us at support@parksheetsapp.com.
